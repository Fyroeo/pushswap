<div align="center">⚠ As for every EPITECH's project, any cheating might result in a -42 ⚠</div><br />
The project is made up of two lists of numbers named l_a and l_b.<br />
In the beginning, l_b will be empty and l_a will contain a certain amount of positive or negative numbers. <br/>
The objective of the project is to sort l_a.<br />

# How the project was handled

The project only use the pb, rb and ra instructions, the optimization is not one of the advantages therefore.<br />
The lack of optimization is due to the algorithm used: the Radix Sort. <br /><br />
You might find all the informations you need on the Radix Sort on this Wikipedia post: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort
